TODO: Detailed settings.

## Set up others.
### Lisp
#### atom-slime
1.  Check atom-slime's "Slime Path" setting.
2.  If the user name in the slime path is diffrent from my current machine's,
    give up syncronize settings and change slime path in the setting.
3.  `cd <parent folder of slime path>` and `hub clone slime/slime`.

TODO: Make it scripts.

### Node.js
1.  `mkdir -p ~/.nodebrew/src`
2.  `nodebrew install-binary stable`
3.  `nodebrew use stable`
4.  Execute `~/Configurations/bundle-npm-packages.sh` after deploying.

### Ruby gems
1.  Set up a Ruby environment (by using `rbenv`).
2.  `gem update` (then `gem cleanup`).
3.  If `bundle` command is not installed since using an old Ruby,
    `gem install bundler`
    If Ruby < 2.3.0., `gem install bundler -v 1.17.3`
4.  Move to `~/Configurations/gem` (after deploying), and `bundle update`
    (then `gem cleanup`).

NOTE: These gems are installed globally (per virtual environment).
We had better to install locally per project with
`bundle install --path=vendor/bundle` as much as we can,
because we can use `bundle clean` with project's bundle file.

TODO: Make it scripts.

### Python
1.  Set up a Python environment (by using `pyenv`).
2.  `pip install --upgrade pip`

        `stack setup` at any directory which does not contain `stack.yaml`.
    *   TODO: To update GHC. (Edit `resolver` in `stack.yaml` in the project
        directory or `~/.stack/global-project`, and `stack setup` again?)
2.  Replace `~/.stack/config.yaml` by that of dotfiles with my `deploy` command.
3.  `~/Configurations/bundle-haskell-stack-packages.sh`

#### haskell-language-server
Download binaries for each GHC version from its repository.
See [docs](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/).

The binaries should be executable (`chmod +x`) and be allowed by the macOS
security.

To let `haskell-language-server-wrapper` choose `haskell-language-server` for
the proper GHC version, the filename of `haskell-language-server` should be
`haskell-language-server-<GHC version>`.

TODO: Make it scripts.

#### intero
Build for each GHC version.
See [docs](https://github.com/chrisdone/intero/blob/master/TOOLING.md).
TODO: Make it scripts.
